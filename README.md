# ModeleR: Optical models in R

## Introduction

This is a set of scripts for running optical models of nanostructures.

## Tips for using the code

Instructions for installing Meep can be found at https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation/

The R script runMeep.R in the R folder is a good place to start. Here, you can select a model (with the `file` argument), change parameters (see a given model CTL file), image the structure in R, and produce reflectance curves in R.

For variable refractive indices, use the R function XX.
